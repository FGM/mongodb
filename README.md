INTRODUCTION
============

MongoDB integration for Drupal, version 8.x-2.0-dev.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fgm/mongodb.svg?branch=8.x-2.x)](https://travis-ci.org/fgm/mongodb) [![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/fgm/mongodb/badges/quality-score.png?b=8.x-2.x)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/fgm/mongodb/?branch=8.x-2.x)

This package is a collection of several modules, allowing Drupal sites to store
various data in MongoDB. Its __only__ currently working sub-modules are the ones
in this table: the other ones are only meant for contributors to work on.

Module                | Information
----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------
mongodb               | Drupal/Drush wrapper around mongodb-php-library.
mongodb_watchdog      | Store logger (watchdog) messages in MongoDB.

As its name implies, this release is currently alpha-level only. Use at your own risk.

Documentation is available on [Github pages]

INSTALLATION AND SETTINGS
=========================

The MongoDB module and sub-modules need some configuration to be useful. This guide assumes that :

* a [MongoDB][download] 3.0 or later instance is already installed, configured,
  and available to connect to from the Drupal instance.
* the site will be running [Drupal][drupal] 8.[56].x.
* the [mongodb][mongodb] (not [mongo][mongo]) PHP extension version 1.1.7 or later is installed and configured.
* PHP is version 7.[01].x. At this point, [PHP 7.2.x][php72] might not pass the
  test suite. It should be compatible by the time Drupal 8.6.0 is released.

[download]: https://www.mongodb.org/downloads
[drupal]: https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal
[php]: http://php.net/downloads.php
[mongo]: http://php.net/mongo
[mongodb]: http://php.net/mongodb
[php72]: https://www.drupal.org/node/2936045

If MongoDB 3.0 to 3.5 is installed on `localhost:27017` and `mongod` was started
with the `â€“httpinterface` option, you may view the web admin interface:

    http://localhost:28017/

* Download the module package, as per [Installing contributed modules (Drupal 8)][install]
* Copy the relevant section from the `mongodb/example.settings.local.php` to
  your `settings.local.php` file if you use one, or `settings.php` otherwise,
  and adapt it to match your MongoDB settings. These settings are used by the
  `mongodb` module to connect to your MongoDB servers, with the `default` server
   being the one started in previous steps.
  * The `clients` key contains an associative array of connection by
    connection alias, with the default connection parameters being under the
    `default` key, and additional keys allowing the use of other servers/clusters.
  * The `databases` key contains an associative array of server/database pairs by
    database alias, with the default Drupal database being under the `default`
    key, and additional keys allowing modules to use their own database to avoid
    stepping on each other's toes. This is especially useful for bespoke modules
    created for the needs of a specific site, which can thus use their own
    databases, possibly on other MongoDB clusters. For example, with the following
    settings:

        ```php
        $settings['mongodb'] = [
          'clients' => [
            // Client alias => connection constructor parameters.
            'default' => [
              'uri' => 'mongodb://localhost:27017',
              'uriOptions' => [],
              'driverOptions' => [],
            ],
          ],
          'databases' => [
            // Database alias => [ client_alias, database_name ]
            'default' => ['default', 'drupal'],
            'logger' => ['default', 'logger'],
          ],
        ];
        ```
    * the `default` database alias will handle collections in the `drupal` database
      on the `default` MongoDB server installed in earlier steps
    * the `logger` database alias will create its collections on the same
      `default` MongoDB server, but in a separate `logger` database.

Once the module is installed and enabled, you can check its requirements on
`/admin/reports/status`:

COMPOSER REQUIREMENTS
---------------------

* Commands below are for those who are using composer already in your site to manage module dependencies. To know more about composer [here][composer]

[composer]: https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-manage-drupal-site-dependencies

* At the root of your site, add a composer requirement by typing:

        composer require mongodb/mongodb "^1.0.0"
* If this is the first Composer dependency on the project, from the site root,
  run:

        composer install
* Enable the `mongodb` module. You now have access to the MongoDB services and
  Drush commands.

[install]: https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8


EXPORTABLE CONFIGURATION
========================
mongodb_watchdog
----------------

The module uses a separate database, using the `logger` database alias in settings.
Do NOT point that alias to the same database as `default`, because the module
drops the logger database when uninstalling, which would drop all your other data
with it.

* `mongodb.watchdog.items`: the maximum item limit on the capped collection used
  by the module. If not defined, it defaults to 10000. The actual (size-based)
  limit is derived from this variable, assuming 1 kiB per watchdog entry.
* `mongodb.watchdog.limit`: the maximum severity level (0 to 7, per RFC 5424) to
  save into watchdog. Errors below this level (with a higher numerical level)
  will be ignored by the module. If not defined, all events will saved.
* `mongodb.watchdog.items_per_page`: the maximum number of events displayed on
  the event details page.
* `mongodb_watchdog.request_tracking`: if true, enable the per-request event
   tracking. If not defined, it defaults to false because its cost is not
   entirely negligible. This feature requires the use of `mod_unique_id` in
   Apache 2.x
* `mongodb_watchdog.requests`: if request tracking is enabled, this setting
  defined the maximum requests limit on the capped collection used by the
  module. If not defined, it defaults to 100000. The actual (size-based) limit
  is derived from this variable, assuming 1 kiB per tracker entry.

See [Drupal\Core\Logger\RfcLogLevel][levels] and [Psr\Log\LogLevel][levelnames]
for further information about severity levels.

WRITING CUSTOM CODE
===================

To write your own custom modules on top of MongoDB while avoiding compatibility
issues with this suite, you probably want to write on top of the `mongodb`
module, using the `mongodb.client_factory` and/or `mongodb.database_factory`
services instead of accessing the PHP library or MongoDB extension directly.

Using module-specific database aliases will allow your module to take advantage
of the features provided by the `mongodb` module while keeping your custom data
in an entirely separate database.


DATABASES AND COLLECTIONS REFERENCE
===================================

Module                | Database alias | Collection(s)      | Information
----------------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------------
`mongodb`             | `default`      | (none)             | Checks alias/client consistency
`mongodb_watchdog`    | `logger`       | `watchdog`         | Event types
&uarr;                | &uarr;         | `watchdog_tracker` | Capped collection for requests
&uarr;                | &uarr;         | `watchdog_*`       | Capped collections for events

Earlier versions used to support a collection aliasing mechanism. With this
version generalizing dedicated databases per module, this is no longer needed
and the associated machinery has been removed.
