#Installation and Settings
The MongoDB module and sub-modules need some configuration to be useful. This
guide assumes that :

* a [MongoDB][download] 3.0 to 3.6 instance is already installed, configured, and
  available to connect to from the Drupal instance.
* the site will be running [Drupal][drupal] 8.[56].x, with [Drush][drush] 8.x.
* the [mongodb][mongodb] (not [mongo][mongo]) PHP extension version 1.1.7 or
  later is installed and configured.
* PHP is version 7.[01].x. At this point, [PHP 7.2.x][php72] might not pass the
  test suite. It should be compatible by the time Drupal 8.6.0 is released.

[download]: https://www.mongodb.org/downloads
[drupal]: https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal
[drush]: https://www.drupal.org/project/drush
[php]: http://php.net/downloads.php
[mongo]: http://php.net/mongo
[mongodb]: http://php.net/mongodb
[php72]: https://www.drupal.org/node/2936045

If MongoDB 3.0 to 3.5 is installed on `localhost:27017` and `mongod` was started
with the `â€“httpinterface` option, you may view the web admin interface:

    http://localhost:28017/

* Download the module package, as per
  [Installing contributed modules (Drupal 8)][install]
* Copy the relevant section from the `mongodb/example.settings.local.php` to
  your `settings.local.php` file if you use one, or `settings.php` otherwise,
  and adapt it to match your MongoDB settings. These settings are used by the
  `mongodb` module to connect to your MongoDB servers, with the `default` server
   being the one started in previous steps.
  * The `clients` key contains an associative array of connection by
    connection alias, with the default connection parameters being under the
    `default` key, and additional keys allowing the use of other
    servers/clusters.
  * The `databases` key contains an associative array of server/database pairs
    by database alias, with the default Drupal database being under the
    `default` key, and additional keys allowing modules to use their own
    database to avoid stepping on each other's toes. This is especially useful
    for bespoke modules created for the needs of a specific site, which can thus
    use their own databases, possibly located on other MongoDB clusters.
    For example, with the following settings:

```php
// In sites/default/settings.local.php.
$settings['mongodb'] = [
  'clients' => [
    // Client alias => connection constructor parameters.
    'default' => [
      'uri' => 'mongodb://localhost:27017',
      'uriOptions' => [],
      'driverOptions' => [],
    ],
  ],
  'databases' => [
    // Database alias => [ client_alias, database_name ]
    'default' => ['default', 'drupal'],
    'keyvalue' => ['default', 'keyvalue'],
    'logger' => ['default', 'logger'],
  ],
];
```
  * With these settings:
    * the `default` database alias will handle collections in the `drupal`
      database on the `default` MongoDB server installed in earlier steps
    * the `keyvalue` database alias will store key-value collections on the
      same `default` MongoDB server, but in a separate `keyvalue` database.
    * the `logger` database alias will store logger collections on the same
      `default` MongoDB server, but in a separate `logger` database.
* To use the MongoDB Key-Value (Expirable) storage:
  * ensure there is a `keyvalue` database alias in `settings.local.php`, like
    in the previous lines.
  * declare MongoDB as the default keyvalue storage implementation by editing
    the existing declarations in the `sites/default/services.yml` file:

```yaml
# In sites/default/services.yml.
factory.keyvalue:
  default: keyvalue.mongodb
factory.keyvalue.expirable:
  keyvalue_expirable_default: keyvalue.expirable.mongodb
```

  * enable the `mongodb_storage` module, e.g. using `drush en mongodb_storage`.
  * import the existing Key-Value contents from the database, using the Drush
    `mongodb_storage-import-keyvalue` command: `drush most-ikv`. It will output
    the list of imported keys, for your information, like:

```yaml
key_value
  config.entity.key_store.action
    uuid:054e62b3-1c40-4f22-aa17-c092bd796ee8
    uuid:0cfd15f5-c01a-4912-991c-ad10e934f86e
(...lots of line, then...)
key_value_expire
  update_available_releases
    drupal
```

  * rebuild the container to take these changes into account using `drush cr`.

Once the module is installed and enabled, you can check its requirements on
`/admin/reports/status`:

##Composer Requirements

* Commands below are for those who are using composer already in your site to
  manage module dependencies. To know more about composer [here][composer].

[composer]: https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-manage-drupal-site-dependencies

* At the root of your site
  * If you are using the `drupal-composer/drupal-project` skeleton, just add
    this package:

        composer require drupal/mongodb "^2.0.0"
  * Otherwise also add a composer requirement by typing:

        composer require drupal/mongodb "^2.0.0"
        composer require mongodb/mongodb "^1.2.0"
* If this is the first Composer dependency on the project, from the site root,
  run:

        composer install
* Enable the `mongodb` module. You now have access to the MongoDB services and
  Drush commands.
